  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>This task is designed to resemble our frontend development environment and get you working on some realistic dummy data.</p>

  <p>We are interested in the price history of <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/bonds/">company bonds</a>. There is some raw data available from two API endpoints, which for this task are provided as files on our server holding JSON data. A brief description of these files is provided after the requirements are defined.</p>

  <p>Extend this stub application to fulfill as many as possible of the requirements described below. Bonus points are given for well-thought out UI decisions, useful interactivity or interesting features beyond the requirements. Don't worry too much about doing things perfectly; this isn't necessarily intended to be a production ready scalable app!</p>
  <p><a ui-sref="companies">This link</a> should go to the main page listing the companies in the dataset.</p>

  <p>Please feel free to contact us if any aspects of the requirements are unclear.</p>

  <br>
  <h4>Requirements</h4>
  The system:
  <ul>
	  <li><b>MUST</b> display a list of the companies in the <tt>companies.json</tt> dataset.</li>
	  <li><b>MUST</b> provide a view for each company, displaying their basic info and some details on their relevant bonds.</li>
	  <li><b>SHOULD</b> display the history of the price of each bond.</li>
	  <li><b>COULD</b> show a list of the highest five moving bond prices. This means the difference between the opening and closing bond price for a particular time period. The time period could be set to 1 day, 1 week or 1 month.</li>
  </ul>

  <br>
  <h4>JSON file description</h4>
  Two files are provided representing the output from two API services:
  <ul>
	  <li><b>https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/capso.test.data/companies.json</b></li>
	  <ul>
		  <li>
			  &nbsp;&nbsp;This example describes the basic information for companies with IDs 1 and 2:
			  <pre>
{
	results: [
		{
			companyId: 1,
			legalName: "Coca Cola Inc.",
			address: "New York",
			revenue: 1000000000,
			employees: 23450,
			industry: Food
		},
		{
			companyId: 2,
			legalName: "Pepsi Cola Inc.",
			address: "London",
			revenue: 400000000,
			employees: 5430,
			industry: Food
		}
	],
	total: 2
}</pre>
		  </li>
	  </ul>
	  <li><b>https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/capso.test.data/bondmaster.json</b></li>
	  <ul>
		  <li>
			  &nbsp;&nbsp;This example describes the basic information for bond IDs 1 and 5. The <b>issuerId</b> fields correspond to the company IDs listed in the <b>companies.json</b> dataset. Note that each issuer company might have multiple bonds.
			  <pre>
{
	1: {
		cusip: 3125412,
		couponRate: 8.21,
		issuerId: 2,
		prices: [ { time: x, price: y }, ... ]
	},
	5: {
		cusip: 888,
		couponRate: 5,
		issuerId: 3,
		prices: [ ... ]
	}
}</pre>
		  </li>
	  </ul>
  </ul>
